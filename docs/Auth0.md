### Auth0 Integration

[Auth0](https://auth0.com/) is a third-party service that simplifies integrating authentication into a web application.

The main use of Auth0 will be for [Oauth 2.0](https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/oauth2) authentication requesting an [*implicit grant*](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.2) flow. Auth0 also hosts the login/oauth authentication forms.

While Auth0 provides a depth of user-security services such as authorization (scopes/roles), multi-factor authentication, currently only basic authentication will be used.
