## Architecture
Single-Page App (SPA) Modules are NodeJS applications that consist of a client-side application that loads and runs within a users browsers. While a SPA is a fully functional application and doesn't need backend support, it easily meets its limitations when relegated to solely the resources of a web browser.

Single-page apps are able to expand their capabilities by connecting to external datasources or other services, usually through a web API(application programming interface). These APIs allow the web app to pull in curated data from other sources like trade exchanges or movie information, connect to functionality that allows the app to authenticate, create, manage and save information in databases and much more.
