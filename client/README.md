# Advance Algos Shop Module client-side Application

This is the Advanced Algos Team Module client-side web app a.k.a. single-page-application (SPA). We use Webpack 4 + Docker to develop locally, then build to a distribution bundle that can then be uploaded via FTP, git or used with a continuous integration workflow.

This webapp's server-side component is the [aateam-api package](../aateam-api#README).

For more information on the general architecture and related technology of this module, please visit this repos [main documenation](../../docs#README).  

## Getting Started

Run
```
		npm install
```
then
```
		npm run dev
```

### Using Docker

Get latest Docker and Docker Compose: [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

#### Using Docker container for Development

To run starter kit in development mode with hot code reload execute:

Run docker container in background:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

If image issues, try running:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
then run
```
docker-compose up -d
```

To view logs
```
docker-compose logs -f -t
```
Hit Ctrl + c to exit logs without stopping service

To stop service
```
docker-compose down
```

## Overview
The development architecture of the Algobots Community site is to allow both rapid initial development and ongoing rapid-evolution. As with any opinionated workflow, there's a learning curve, but the libraries and architecture of this application have been chosen to maximize collaboration, flexibility, and extensibility.

### Main Libraries

- [*Webpack 4*](https://webpack.js.org/):web application bundler. Allows us to us latest newer JS ECMA features that increase productivity and code clarity. Also allows additional libraries such as modular and programmable CSS via SASS/SCSS/LESS. Provides webserver for local development.
- [*Bulma CSS Framework*](https://bulma.io/documentation/): Bulma is a highly-customizable CSS-only framework allowing us to quickly prototype the layout of a webapp without being complicated by opinionated functionality represented in libraries such as Bootstrap or Material UI. Grants us the flexibility to create a custom look at top speed whilst minimizing baggage.
- [*HyperApp*](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp): Allows a controlled Flux-styled approach to state-management and data-flow through components like React minus the excess boilerplate and learning curve.
- [*Docker*](https://www.docker.com/what-docker)

```

## Deployment

The simplest deployment is compiling/transpiling the site to a distribution bundle and then uploading the files in the bundle to a web-accessible folder or storage.

For this application we use Webpack to transpile the application which combines and minimizes all code and assets into an optimized bundle without and of the development code and resources.

To build, run:
```
	npm run build
```
Looking in this packages directory, there should be a ./build directory with the final built files that can be uploaded.
